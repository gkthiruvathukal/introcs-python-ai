# AGENTS.md — Introduction to Computer Science in Python

This file gives AI agents and contributors a complete picture of the project:
what it is, where things stand, and how to work on it effectively.

## What this project is

**Introduction to Computer Science in Python: Principles and Practice** is a
Sphinx-based course textbook for Comp 170 (Introduction to Computer Science) at
Loyola University Chicago.  It is authored by the Computer Science Department
Faculty at Loyola University Chicago.

The book teaches introductory CS concepts using Python.  It is a ground-up
Python rewrite of the prior C# edition (`introcs-csharp`, located at
`~/Work/introcs-csharp`).  Chapter structure and pedagogical arc are preserved;
all code and language-specific explanations are Python-native.

The book's broader argument — that programming, data structures, and algorithms
should be taught as foundations for systems and engineering thinking, especially
in the age of AI — is articulated in:

> Chandra N. Sekharan and George K. Thiruvathukal,
> *"Now's the Time: Computer Science Must Evolve to Emphasize Software and
> Systems Engineering with Artificial Intelligence (AI),"*
> IEEE Computer, Education Department, 2026.
> https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.27230

## Source material

When adapting or adding content, draw from:

1. **`~/Work/introcs-csharp`** — the C# predecessor; primary source for
   chapter structure, example programs, and narrative voice.
2. **`~/Work/SE4ML`** — secondary source for systems/AI framing.
3. **`~/Work/comp-501-book`** — PhD student contributions (COMP 501, Loyola);
   source for: hardware/software, terminal, modules/scope, user input, error
   handling, lists of dicts, dict algorithms, internet data, GUI chapters.
4. **`~/Work/operatingsystems`** — Linux terminal examples drawn from
   `source/introduction.rst`.

Every RST file contributed by PhD students carries a `.. note::` attribution:
`*Source:* Contributed by PhD students in COMP 501 at Loyola University Chicago.`

```

Each chapter follows the two-file pattern:
- `chapter/chapter.rst` — container: `#`-underlined title + toctree
- `chapter/overview.rst` (or multiple sub-files) — content: `=`-underlined title

---

## Build instructions

```bash
# Install dependencies (once) — always use the project .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# HTML (fast, for day-to-day work) — use .venv sphinx-build, not make
.venv/bin/sphinx-build -b html source build/html
open build/html/index.html

# Full clean rebuild (required when adding new toctree entries)
rm -rf build/ && .venv/bin/sphinx-build -b html source build/html

# Check for Sphinx warnings/errors
.venv/bin/sphinx-build -b html source build/html 2>&1 | grep -E "ERROR|WARNING"

# PDF (requires TeX Live full install with xelatex)
make latex
# then compile PDF:
make -C build/latex
open build/latex/introcs-python.pdf

# EPUB
make epub
```

The PDF uses **xelatex** (not pdflatex) because the book contains Unicode
characters throughout. The `texlive-full` CI image already includes all
required fonts — no `tlmgr install` step is needed.

---

## GitHub Actions CI

`.github/workflows/main.yml`:

- **Every push to `main`**: builds HTML, LaTeX, EPUB; compiles PDF with
  `xu-cheng/texlive-action/full`; deploys HTML to GitHub Pages at
  `https://introcs-python.cs.luc.edu`.
- **Tag push (`v*`)**: publishes `introcs-python.pdf` and `introcs-python.epub`
  as GitHub Release assets via `softprops/action-gh-release`.
- **`workflow_dispatch`**: manual trigger from the Actions tab.

Do **not** add `tlmgr install` steps — the full TeXLive image already contains
everything needed, and network-dependent `tlmgr` calls have failed in CI.

---

## RST writing conventions

### File structure

Every content file must follow this pattern:

```rst
.. index:: keyword, another keyword

.. _Label-Name:

Section Title
=============

.. note::

   *Source:* Adapted from the C# edition (``chapter/file.rst``).
   <what changed for Python>

[prose]

.. code-block:: python

   [example]

Output:

.. code-block:: none

   [output]
```

### Heading levels

| Level | Underline char | Used for |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | `#` (no overline) | Chapter container title (`chapter.rst`) |
| 2 | `=` | Section title (top of each content `.rst` file) |
| 3 | `-` | Subsection |
| 4 | `^` | Sub-subsection |

### Code blocks

- `.. code-block:: python` — all Python code
- `.. code-block:: none` — output, shell commands, syntax diagrams
- `.. code-block:: bash` — shell/Linux commands
- Always precede output blocks with a plain `Output:` line (not a directive)
- No `.. literalinclude::` — all code is inline

### Review questions

Each numbered review question must contain **exactly one question**.  If a
topic naturally has two parts, use `a.` / `b.` / `c.` sub-items:

```rst
#.  Main question stem.

    a.  Part one.
    b.  Part two.
```

### Voice and tone

- Direct, instructional, patient — follow the C# edition's style
- Explain the *why*, not just the *what*
- Second person ("you", "your program")
- Bold (`**term**`) for key terms when first introduced in characteristics lists
- Prefer prose paragraphs over bullet lists
- Soften absolute statements: prefer "is unlikely to" over "cannot"

---

## Python idioms to prefer

- f-strings over `%` or `.format()`
- `pathlib.Path` over `os.path`
- `with open(...) as f:` for all file I/O
- `for item in iterable:` over index-based loops where natural
- `snake_case` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for classes
- Raise `ValueError` for invalid arguments (not silent failure)
- **pandas** for all tabular/CSV data work — `pd.read_csv`, `df.to_csv(index=False)`,
  boolean indexing, `value_counts()`, `groupby()`.  Do not use `csv.DictReader`/
  `csv.DictWriter` or `collections.Counter` for tasks pandas handles naturally.

---

## C# → Python translation reference

| C# | Python |
|----|--------|
| `Console.WriteLine(x)` | `print(x)` |
| `Console.Write(x)` | `print(x, end='')` |
| `Console.ReadLine()` | `input()` |
| `int.Parse(s)` / `double.Parse(s)` | `int(s)` / `float(s)` |
| `{0:F2}` format strings | f-string `{value:.2f}` |
| `//` comments | `#` comments |
| `&&`, `\|\|`, `!` | `and`, `or`, `not` |
| `else if` | `elif` |
| `foreach (var x in seq)` | `for x in seq:` |
| `List<T>` | `list` |
| `Dictionary<K,V>` | `dict` |
| `Stack<T>` | `list` (append/pop) |
| `Queue<T>` | `collections.deque` |
| NUnit `[Test]` / `Assert.AreEqual` | pytest `def test_*` / `assert` |
| `null` | `None` |

## Key content notes

### Computing history chapter (`source/computing_history/`)

Preliminary — not intended to be exhaustive. Based primarily on the author's
own published works:
- "Episodes in Computing History — Salon Talk" (Thiruvathukal, 2025)
- "Computer Science and Cultural History: A Dialogue" (Thiruvathukal & Dennis, CESTEMER 2017)
- "AI &| ML" panel talk (Thiruvathukal, LUCRA 2024)
- CiSE Editor-in-Chief mini-history project (2013–2016)

### Terminal chapter (`source/terminal/`)

Extended with Linux command examples drawn from `~/Work/operatingsystems/source/introduction.rst`.
Covers: pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, whoami, cat, touch, cp, mv, rm, echo, less, grep,
find, plus File Permissions (chmod, chown) and Process Management (ps, top, kill).

### Recursion chapter

- `recursionintro.rst`: shows recursive *and* iterative factorial/Fibonacci
  side-by-side; both versions validate input with `ValueError` for negative n;
  includes "No Tail-Call Optimisation" and "Security Implications of Unbounded
  Recursion" subsections.
- `recursionexamples.rst`: ends with a "Generators for Sequences with a Ceiling"
  section showing infinite generators + `itertools.takewhile`.

### Case studies chapter (`source/case_studies/`)

Two complete case studies, both using **pandas** and **matplotlib**:

- **Monte Carlo simulation** (`monte_carlo.rst`) — estimates π by throwing random
  darts.  Pipeline: `generate_darts` → `save_darts` → `load_darts` → `estimate_pi`.
  The generate/save/load separation mirrors the Scala workshop design.
  Visualisation in `monte_carlo_plot.py` (scatter plot + convergence grid).
- **Chicago 311 Graffiti** (`graffiti_311.rst`) — full fetch→load→aggregate→filter→
  visualise pipeline against the Chicago Data Portal open dataset.
  The CSV (`311_graffiti.csv`) is gitignored; fetch with:
  `python examples/introcs-python/internet_data/graffiti.py fetch`
  Dataset covers 2011–2018 only (portal stopped updating this view).

### Motivation chapter (`source/context/motivation.rst`)

- Includes "Programming in the Age of Artificial Intelligence" section with
  AGI/human-in-the-loop caveat.
- Includes "Software Engineering, Automation, and Prototyping" section.
- References the Sekharan & Thiruvathukal (2026) op-ed.
