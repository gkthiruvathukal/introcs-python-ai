Alignment with ACM/IEEE Curriculum Standards
============================================

.. note::
   *Source:* Python-specific — no direct C# equivalent.

This chapter maps the content of *Introduction to Computer Science in Python*
against the two most widely used computing curriculum frameworks published by
the ACM and IEEE Computer Society:

- **CS2013** — *Computer Science Curricula 2013* (ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Task Force).
  The established reference used by the majority of accredited CS programmes.
  It organises content into **Knowledge Areas (KAs)**, each subdivided into
  **Knowledge Units (KUs)**, with topics rated Core Tier 1, Core Tier 2, or
  Elective.

- **CS2023** — *Computer Science Curricula 2023* (ACM/IEEE-CS, published
  December 2023).  The current revision; it retains the KA/KU structure but
  introduces a competency-based framework and revises the tier terminology
  to *Must* / *Should* / *May*.

.. warning::
   The CS2013 mappings in this chapter are authoritative. The CS2023 notes
   represent the authors' best understanding of a recently published document;
   instructors should verify CS2023 mappings against the official ACM/IEEE-CS
   publication before using them for formal accreditation purposes.

The CS Course Sequence
----------------------

.. index::
   CS0; Computing Principles
   CS1; Introduction to Computer Science
   CS2; Data Structures
   CS3; Algorithms
   course sequence; CS curriculum

The ACM/IEEE curriculum frameworks assume a standard undergraduate CS course
progression. The table below maps the informal labels used in this chapter
to their typical course titles and content focus.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 28 62

   * - Label
     - Common Course Title(s)
     - Focus
   * - **CS0**
     - Computing Principles;
       AP CS Principles;
       Introduction to Computing
     - Conceptual introduction to computing for non-majors or as a bridge
       course. Minimal or no programming; often uses block-based languages
       (Scratch), spreadsheets, or very simple Python/JavaScript scripts.
       Covers the societal impact of computing, the internet, data, and
       algorithms at a high level.
   * - **CS1**
     - Introduction to Computer Science;
       Introduction to Programming;
       Foundations of Computer Science
     - First programming course for majors. Variables, types, expressions,
       conditionals, loops, functions, basic I/O, and introductory data
       structures (lists, dictionaries). Typically taught in Python, Java,
       or C++. *This textbook targets CS1.*
   * - **CS2**
     - Data Structures;
       Data Structures and Algorithms;
       Object-Oriented Programming
     - Second programming course. Inheritance and polymorphism, linked
       lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, and
       introductory complexity analysis (Big-O). OOP design principles.
       Discrete Mathematics is often a co-requisite or prerequisite.
   * - **CS3**
     - Algorithms;
       Algorithm Design and Analysis;
       Systems Programming;
       Computer Organization
     - "CS3" is not a single course — it represents the tier of courses
       taken after CS2. Common CS3-level courses include: a formal
       *Algorithms* course (NP-completeness, dynamic programming,
       graph algorithms), *Systems Programming* (C, memory management,
       processes and threads), and *Computer Organization* (assembly
       language, caches, pipelines).
   * - **CS3+**
     - Compilers; Operating Systems;
       Programming Languages;
       Theory of Computation;
       Artificial Intelligence
     - Upper-division and graduate courses that build on a full CS1–CS3
       foundation. KUs at this level are not expected in an introductory
       curriculum.

How to Read the KA Tables
--------------------------

.. index:: curriculum alignment; coverage levels

Each Knowledge Area table below lists **every** Knowledge Unit in that area —
including units this textbook does not address. The **Coverage** column uses:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 78

   * - Coverage
     - Meaning
   * - **Full**
     - All CS1-expected topics for this KU are substantively addressed.
   * - **Partial — CS1 gap**
     - This textbook covers part of the KU but is missing CS1-level
       content that *should* be added to a CS1 course.
   * - **Partial — CS2 gap**
     - The CS1-level content for this KU is complete. The remaining
       gaps are CS2+ topics that are intentionally deferred.
   * - **Minimal**
     - The topic is touched on incidentally but not developed to the
       depth the standard expects (used mainly for CS2-level KUs where
       the textbook happens to introduce the concept).
   * - **—**
     - Topic is absent from this textbook entirely.

The **Course Level** column shows where a KU is *first expected* in a typical
CS curriculum — CS0, CS1, CS2, CS3, or CS3+. For every row marked CS1,
the Coverage column explicitly flags whether further development is needed
in this book (CS1 gap) or whether the CS1 portion is already complete
(CS2 gap, or Full).

Not-covered counts include both CS1-level gaps and CS2+/CS3+ topics that are
intentionally out of scope for a first course. The per-KA tables distinguish
these via the Course Level column.

Software Development Fundamentals (SDF)
----------------------------------------

.. index::
   ACM-IEEE CS2013; SDF
   ACM-IEEE CS2023; SDF
   SDF; Software Development Fundamentals

SDF is the Knowledge Area most directly targeted by a first programming course.
CS2013 assigns all four KUs to Core Tier 1 or Tier 1/2.  This textbook covers
SDF thoroughly — it is the backbone of the curriculum.

**CS2023 note.** CS2023 retains all four SDF KUs and adds an explicit
competency requiring students to *select* the appropriate control structure
for a given problem — a distinction this textbook honours through its
separate :doc:`While Loops </while/while>` and :doc:`For Loops </for/for>`
chapters.

Programming Languages (PL)
---------------------------

.. index::
   ACM-IEEE CS2013; PL
   ACM-IEEE CS2023; PL
   PL; Programming Languages

CS2013 defines ten PL KUs. PL1 and PL4 are Core Tier 1 CS1 topics; PL2 and
PL3 become relevant by CS2. PL5–PL10 are CS2+/CS3+ and are not expected in
a first course. CS2023 reorganises and elevates type systems and functional
programming.

**CS2023 note.** CS2023 elevates PL2/Functional Programming from Tier 2 to
*Should*, reflecting the industry shift toward functional styles in Python,
JavaScript, and Rust. It also introduces a dedicated *Type Systems and
Semantics* KU aligned with Python's gradual-typing model; the
:ref:`Type Hints <Type-Hints-Functions>` coverage could be deepened to meet
this expectation. Inheritance and polymorphism remain *Must*-level; their
absence is the largest single PL gap.

Algorithms and Complexity (AL)
-------------------------------

.. index::
   ACM-IEEE CS2013; AL
   ACM-IEEE CS2023; AL
   AL; Algorithms and Complexity

CS2013 has seven AL KUs. AL1–AL3 are Core Tier 1 but are primarily taught in
CS2 (Data Structures), where formal analysis, sorting theory, and tree/graph
algorithms are the main subject. AL4–AL7 are Tier 2 or Elective and belong
to a dedicated CS3-level Algorithms course.

**CS2023 note.** CS2023 retains AL1–AL3 at *Must* level and adds stronger
guidance on analysing recursive algorithms via recurrence relations. The
:doc:`Recursion </recursion/recursion>` chapter provides the right examples
but does not derive the corresponding complexity expressions.

Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP)
--------------------------------------------

.. index::
   ACM-IEEE CS2013; SP
   ACM-IEEE CS2023; SP
   SP; Social Issues and Professional Practice

CS2013 has nine SP KUs. SP1–SP3 (Social Context, Analytical Tools, and
Professional Ethics) are Core Tier 1 and are expected in every CS programme
including CS1. SP4–SP6 are Tier 2, appropriate for CS1 but often deferred to
CS2. SP7, SP8, and SP9 are Elective; SP8 (History) is addressed in full.

**CS2023 note.** CS2023 makes Professional Ethics a *Must* topic and expands
it to include AI ethics, algorithmic bias, and data privacy. It also adds a
new *Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion* KU. The
:ref:`Computing History <Computing-History>` chapter partially addresses DEI
history through the ENIAC programmers and Ada Lovelace, but a systematic
treatment is needed.

   AR; Architecture and Organization

CS2013 has eight AR KUs. AR1 and AR2 are Core Tier 1 and expected at a
conceptual level in CS1; AR3 (Assembly Level) is Tier 1 but is the primary
subject of a CS2/CS3-level Computer Organization course. AR4–AR8 are Tier 2
or Elective and belong to upper-division systems courses.

**CS2023 note.** CS2023 retains AR1 and AR2 at *Must* level but clarifies
that a CS1 course need only achieve a *conceptual* treatment of hardware
organisation — gate-level circuits and assembly language remain CS2
expectations.

Software Engineering (SE)

CS2013 has ten SE KUs. SE3 (Tools and Environments) is Core Tier 1 and the
only SE KU expected at CS1. SE1, SE6, and SE7 bridge CS1 and CS2; the
remaining six KUs (SE2, SE4, SE5, SE8–SE10) belong to CS2+ software
engineering courses.

**CS2023 note.** CS2023 promotes version control (Git) to *Must* at the
introductory level, elevating it from a Tier 2 detail to an expected CS1
competency. The existing appendix stub ``lab-versioncontrol.rst`` would, once
completed, close this gap.

Notes on CS2023
---------------

.. index:: CS2023; differences from CS2013, CS2023; competency framework

CS2023 represents an evolution rather than a revolution of CS2013. The
following changes are most relevant to this textbook:

**Competency-based framing.** CS2023 defines *competencies* (knowledge +
skills + dispositions) alongside traditional topic lists. A competency for
SDF2/Fundamental Programming Concepts, for example, requires students not
just to understand loops but to *select the appropriate loop construct* for a
given problem — a distinction this textbook honours through its explicit
:doc:`While Loops </while/while>` vs. :doc:`For Loops </for/for>` chapters.

**Professional Ethics elevated.** Ethics moved from Tier 1/Elective in CS2013
to *Must* in CS2023 across SP2 and SP3. The gap identified above is more
urgent under CS2023.

**Functional programming elevated.** CS2023 raises PL2/Functional Programming
from Tier 2 to *Should* — one level below *Must* — reflecting the industry
trend toward functional styles in Python, JavaScript, and Rust. The
:ref:`List Comprehensions <List-Comprehensions>` section is a good foundation
to build on.

**Type systems expanded.** CS2023 introduces a dedicated *Type Systems and
Semantics* KU (building on PL4) that includes gradual typing — highly relevant
to Python's ``typing`` module and the :ref:`Type Hints <Type-Hints-Functions>`
approach taken throughout this textbook. Deepening that coverage would meet
this expectation.

**Version control promoted.** CS2023 elevates SE3/Version Control to *Must*
at the CS1 level, reflecting industry consensus that Git is a day-one skill.

**New: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.** CS2023 adds a KU requiring
programmes to address DEI in computing contexts. The
:ref:`Computing History <Computing-History>` chapter partially addresses this
through its coverage of the ENIAC programmers and Ada Lovelace, but a more
systematic treatment is needed.

Recommendations for Instructors
---------------------------------

.. index:: curriculum alignment; instructor recommendations

This textbook is designed as a CS1 course and intentionally defers some
topics (formal algorithm analysis, trees and graphs, assembly language,
compilers) to CS2 and later courses. The following additions would bring it
to near-full CS2013 Core Tier 1 coverage for a CS1 context:

1. **Add an ethics section** (closes SP2 + SP3) to
   :doc:`Context </context/context>` covering the ACM Code of Ethics,
   ethical reasoning frameworks, academic integrity, and basic computing law.
   This is the highest-priority gap under both CS2013 and CS2023.

2. **Add an inheritance section** (closes PL1) to
   :doc:`Classes </classes/classes>` demonstrating subclasses, ``super()``,
   and method overriding with a concrete example (e.g., extending the
   ``Contact`` class to ``ProfessionalContact``).

3. **Complete the version control lab** (closes SE3) in
   ``appendix/lab-versioncontrol.rst`` covering Git commits, branches, and
   the pull-request workflow. This is *Must*-level in CS2023.

4. **Weave privacy and IP notes** (partially closes SP4 + SP5) into
   :ref:`Internet Data <Internet-Data>` when discussing API keys, rate
   limits, and data collected from users.

Topics such as formal Big-O proofs, binary search trees, greedy algorithms,
and machine-level data representation are better addressed in CS2 (Data
Structures). Topics such as Boolean gates, assembly language, and the
fetch-decode-execute cycle belong in a CS2/CS3-level Computer Organization
course. This textbook lays the groundwork for all of them through its
coverage of :doc:`Recursion </recursion/recursion>`,
:doc:`Data Structures </datastructures/datastructures>`,
and the :ref:`Hardware <Hardware-And-Software>` and
:ref:`Computing History <Computing-History>` chapters.
