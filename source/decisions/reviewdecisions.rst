Chapter Review Questions
========================

.. note::

   *Source:* Adapted from the C# edition (``decisions/reviewdecisions.rst``).
   Questions 7–10 are original additions.

1. Two similar-looking operators.

   a.  What does ``=`` do in Python?
   b.  What does ``==`` do?
   c.  Give a one-line example of each.

2. Python's Boolean operators.

   a.  Name all three.
   b.  How do they differ from the C# equivalents (``&&``, ``||``, ``!``)?

3. What is printed?

   .. code-block:: python

      x = 7
      if x > 5:
          print("big")
      if x > 10:
          print("very big")
      else:
          print("not very big")

4. Short-circuit evaluation.

   a.  What does *short-circuit evaluation* mean?
   b.  Give an example where it prevents a runtime error.

5. Rewrite this nested ``if`` using a single condition with ``and``:

   .. code-block:: python

      if age >= 18:
          if has_id:
              print("Entry allowed.")

6. What is the bug in this code?  Fix it.

   .. code-block:: python

      score = 85
      if score >= 90:
          grade = "A"
      if score >= 80:
          grade = "B"
      if score >= 70:
          grade = "C"
      print(grade)

7. Write a function ``absolute_value(x)`` using an ``if``/``else``
   statement that returns the absolute value of ``x`` without using
   ``abs()``.

8. Write a function ``sign(x)`` that returns ``1`` if ``x > 0``,
   ``-1`` if ``x < 0``, and ``0`` if ``x == 0``.

9. Write a function ``is_leap_year(year)`` that returns ``True`` if
   ``year`` is a leap year.  A year is a leap year if it is divisible
   by 4, *except* centuries (divisible by 100) are not leap years, *unless*
   they are also divisible by 400.

10. What does this expression evaluate to, and what type does it produce?

    .. code-block:: python

       "pass" if 75 >= 60 else "fail"
