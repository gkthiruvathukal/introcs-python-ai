Resources Online
================

This book is designed for the introductory computer science course at Loyola
University Chicago.  The materials are available to all on the web.

.. note::

   For all work in this course, install Python 3 and use the command-line
   tools.  The basic workflow is:

   1. Write a ``.py`` file in a text editor (Vim or Emacs recommended).
   2. Run it from the terminal::

         python3 filename.py

   You can also experiment interactively by typing ``python3`` at the
   terminal to enter the interactive shell.

*  The course example repository will contain all example programs referenced
   in the book.  Download or clone it and keep it alongside your work.

*  `python.org <https://www.python.org>`_ is the official Python website.
   It includes documentation for the standard library and language reference.

*  We recommend learning a terminal-based editor such as `Vim <https://www.vim.org>`_
   or `GNU Emacs <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_.  Mastering one of these
   builds habits — editing, navigating, and running code — that transfer directly
   to any command-line environment.  `Visual Studio Code
   <https://code.visualstudio.com>`_ is an acceptable alternative, but you will get
   more out of it once you are comfortable working between an editor and the shell.

The Interactive Shell
---------------------

Python provides an interactive shell (also called a REPL, for
Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) that lets you type expressions and see their
values immediately.  Start it by typing ``python3`` at your terminal:

.. code-block:: none

   $ python3
   Python 3.12.0 (default, ...)
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>>

Type any expression and press Enter::

   >>> 2 + 3
   5
   >>> "Hello, world!"
   'Hello, world!'

This is very useful for experimenting with small pieces of code.  We will use
the ``>>>`` prompt throughout the book to show interactive examples.

To exit the shell, type ``quit()`` or press Ctrl-D.
